# Commercial Pilot Privileges and Limitations

Earning a Commercial Pilot Certificate is a major milestone for any aviator. It opens the door to flying for compensation or hire—something private pilots cannot do. However, the privileges come with important limitations and requirements outlined primarily in **14 CFR §61.133**.

This post breaks down the key privileges and limitations of a Commercial Pilot Certificate under current FAA regulations (as of December 2025).

## General Privileges

A holder of a Commercial Pilot Certificate may act as **Pilot in Command (PIC)** of an aircraft:

- Carrying persons or property **for compensation or hire**, provided the pilot is qualified under Part 61 and any other applicable regulations (e.g., Parts 91, 121, 135, etc.).
- **For compensation or hire** (e.g., being paid to fly an aircraft without carrying passengers or cargo for hire).

These privileges allow commercial pilots to pursue careers such as flight instruction, banner towing, aerial photography, crop dusting, or flying for Part 135 charter operations (with appropriate operator certification).

**Important Note**: Many operations involving the carriage of persons or property for hire require the operator to hold a commercial operating certificate under Part 119 (e.g., Parts 121 or 135). The commercial pilot certificate alone does not authorize common carriage (on-demand air transportation) without such certification. Certain exceptions exist under §119.1(e), such as non-stop sightseeing flights, ferry flights, aerial work, and skydiving operations.

## Special Privileges for Lighter-Than-Air Ratings

Pilots with a **lighter-than-air category** rating (airship or balloon) have additional privileges, including:

### For Airships:
- Providing flight and ground training for certificates/ratings.
- Endorsing logbooks for solo or ratings.
- Acting as PIC under IFR or in sub-VFR conditions.
- Providing training/endorsements for flight reviews or recency.

### For Balloons:
- Providing training and endorsements for certificates/ratings or solo flight.
- Providing training/endorsements for flight reviews or recency.

## Key Limitations

### 1. No Instrument Rating (Airplane or Powered-Lift Categories)
If the commercial pilot certificate is issued **without an instrument rating** in the same category and class:

> "The carriage of passengers for hire in (airplanes) (powered-lifts) on cross-country flights in excess of 50 nautical miles or at night is prohibited."

This limitation is automatically applied if the applicant lacks the instrument rating. It can be removed by obtaining an instrument rating in the same category and class (§61.65 requirements).

### 2. Balloon Rating Limitations
- If the practical test is taken in a balloon with an **airborne heater**, the certificate is limited to balloons with airborne heaters.
- If taken in a **gas balloon**, the certificate is limited to gas balloons.

These restrictions can be removed by completing additional training and testing in the other type.

### 3. Operational and Regulatory Compliance
All operations must comply with applicable FARs. For example:
- Commercial pilots cannot "hold out" to the public for common carriage without proper certification.
- Expense-sharing flights are limited (similar to private pilot rules under §61.113(c)).

## Final Thoughts

The Commercial Pilot Certificate significantly expands your flying opportunities, but it is not a blanket authorization to conduct any paid flight. Always ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, including operational rules and any required operator certifications.

For the most current details, refer directly to **14 CFR §61.133** on the FAA website or eCFR.

Safe flying!
