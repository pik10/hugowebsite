# FAA Medical Certificate Classes and Validity Periods

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates aviation medical certificates under [14 CFR §61.23](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-61/subpart-A/section-61.23), specifying requirements and validity periods for pilots based on the type of operation, pilot certificate, and age at the time of the medical examination. This article outlines the three classes of medical certificates—first-class, second-class, and third-class—their associated privileges, validity periods, and how a first-class medical certificate can be used for second-class privileges, particularly addressing the case of a pilot under 40.

## Medical Certificate Classes and Requirements

1. **First-Class Medical Certificate**:
   - **Required for**: Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) privileges, such as pilots flying for major airlines.
   - **Used for**: Can also be used for commercial and private pilot privileges with extended validity periods for lower-level operations.

2. **Second-Class Medical Certificate**:
   - **Required for**: Commercial pilot privileges, such as flight instructors, charter pilots, or other paid operations not requiring ATP certification.
   - **Used for**: Can also be used for private pilot privileges.

3. **Third-Class Medical Certificate**:
   - **Required for**: Private pilot, recreational pilot, student pilot, and flight instructor privileges (when acting as pilot in command or required crewmember).

## Validity Periods

The validity of a medical certificate depends on the pilot’s age at the time of the examination, the class of the certificate, and the type of operation. All validity periods extend to the **end of the last day of the specified calendar month** from the date of the examination.

### First-Class Medical Certificate
- **For ATP privileges**:
  - Age under 40: Valid for **12 months**.
  - Age 40 or older: Valid for **6 months**.
- **For commercial privileges** (equivalent to second-class):
  - Valid for **12 months**, regardless of age.
- **For private pilot privileges** (equivalent to third-class):
  - Age under 40: Valid for **60 months** (5 years).
  - Age 40 or older: Valid for **24 months** (2 years).

### Second-Class Medical Certificate
- **For commercial privileges**:
  - Valid for **12 months**, regardless of age.
- **For private pilot privileges**:
  - Age under 40: Valid for **60 months** (5 years).
  - Age 40 or older: Valid for **24 months** (2 years).

### Third-Class Medical Certificate
- **For private pilot privileges**:
  - Age under 40: Valid for **60 months** (5 years).
  - Age 40 or older: Valid for **24 months** (2 years).

### Summary Table

| **Medical Class** | **Operation Type**          | **Age**         | **Validity Period** |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **First-Class**   | ATP privileges              | Under 40        | 12 months           |
|                    |                             | 40 or older     | 6 months            |
|                    | Commercial privileges       | Any age         | 12 months           |
|                    | Private pilot privileges    | Under 40        | 60 months           |
|                    |                             | 40 or older     | 24 months           |
| **Second-Class**  | Commercial privileges       | Any age         | 12 months           |
|                    | Private pilot privileges    | Under 40        | 60 months           |
|                    |                             | 40 or older     | 24 months           |
| **Third-Class**   | Private pilot privileges    | Under 40        | 60 months           |
|                    |                             | 40 or older     | 24 months           |

## Using a First-Class Medical Certificate for Second-Class Privileges

A common question is whether a first-class medical certificate, after expiring for ATP privileges, can still be used for second-class (commercial) privileges, especially since both have a 12-month validity period for certain pilots. The answer depends on the pilot’s age:

- **Pilots under 40**:
  - A first-class medical certificate issued, for example, on **August 1, 2024**, is valid for **ATP privileges** until **August 31, 2025** (12 months, to the end of the calendar month).
  - It is also valid for **second-class (commercial) privileges** until **August 31, 2025** (12 months).
  - Since the validity periods for ATP and commercial privileges expire simultaneously, once the certificate expires for ATP privileges on August 31, 2025, it **cannot** be used for second-class privileges beyond that date. It remains valid for **private pilot privileges** until **August 31, 2029** (60 months).

- **Pilots 40 or older**:
  - A first-class medical certificate issued on **August 1, 2024**, is valid for **ATP privileges** until **January 31, 2025** (6 months).
  - It remains valid for **second-class (commercial) privileges** until **August 31, 2025** (12 months).
  - Thus, after ATP privileges expire on January 31, 2025, the certificate can still be used for commercial privileges for an additional 6 months (until August 31, 2025).

### Why the Difference?
The regulation allows a higher-class medical certificate (e.g., first-class) to serve as a lower-class certificate (e.g., second-class) for the duration specified for those privileges. For pilots under 40, the 12-month validity for ATP and commercial privileges aligns, so there’s no additional period for second-class privileges after ATP expiration. For pilots 40 or older, the shorter 6-month ATP validity allows the certificate to remain valid for commercial privileges for an additional 6 months, up to the 12-month mark.

## Additional Notes
- **BasicMed Alternative**: For certain private pilot operations, pilots may use **BasicMed** instead of a third-class medical certificate, requiring a medical exam every 48 months and an online course every 24 months. This applies to specific aircraft (e.g., up to 6,000 pounds takeoff weight, carrying no more than 6 occupants).
- **Exemptions**: No medical certificate is required for gliders, balloons, or sport pilot privileges (with a valid U.S. driver’s license and no known unsafe medical conditions). Flight instructors not acting as pilot in command may also be exempt in certain cases.
- **Carrying the Certificate**: Pilots must carry a valid medical certificate (or comply with BasicMed) when exercising the privileges of their pilot certificate, except where exemptions apply.
