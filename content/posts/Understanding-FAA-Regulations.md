- **Certificates and Ratings**: Specifies requirements for certificates like Private Pilot, Commercial Pilot, and Airline Transport Pilot (ATP), as well as ratings such as instrument, type ratings for specific aircraft, and flight instructor credentials.
- **Training Requirements**: Details minimum flight hours, ground training, and proficiency checks. For example, a Private Pilot Certificate requires at least 40 hours of flight time (though most students need more).
- **Recency of Experience**: Includes rules for maintaining currency, such as completing a flight review every 24 months or meeting specific takeoff and landing requirements for carrying passengers.
- **Flight Instructors**: Governs certification and responsibilities of flight instructors, including their role in endorsing students for solo flights or practical tests.

**Who It Affects**: Student pilots, certificated pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors.

**Example**: A student pilot pursuing a Private Pilot Certificate must meet Part 61 requirements, including 40 hours of flight time (with at least 20 hours of flight training and 10 hours of solo flight) and passing a practical test with an FAA examiner.

## FAR Part 67: Medical Certification and Standards

**FAR Part 67** establishes the medical certification requirements for pilots and other airmen to ensure they are physically and mentally fit to operate aircraft safely.

### Key Points:
- **Scope**: Defines medical standards for issuing and maintaining FAA medical certificates required for most pilot operations.
- **Classes of Medical Certificates**:
  - **First-Class**: Required for Airline Transport Pilots (e.g., airline pilots operating under Part 121). Valid for 12 months for pilots under 40, and 6 months for pilots 40 and older.
  - **Second-Class**: Required for Commercial Pilots (e.g., those operating under Part 135 or other commercial operations). Valid for 12 months.
  - **Third-Class**: Required for Private Pilots, recreational pilots, and student pilots. Valid for 60 months for pilots under 40, and 24 months for pilots 40 and older.
- **Medical Standards**: Specifies physical and mental health requirements, including vision, hearing, cardiovascular health, and absence of disqualifying conditions (e.g., epilepsy, substance dependence).
- **BasicMed**: An alternative to the Third-Class medical certificate for certain pilots operating under Part 91. Pilots must complete a medical exam with a state-licensed physician every 48 months and an online course every 24 months, with restrictions on aircraft size, passengers, and flight conditions.
- **Special Issuance**: Allows pilots with certain medical conditions (e.g., controlled diabetes) to obtain a medical certificate through a special issuance process, subject to FAA review.
- **Examinations**: Conducted by FAA-designated Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs), who assess applicants based on Part 67 standards.

**Who It Affects**: All pilots and flight crew members requiring an FAA medical certificate, except those operating under BasicMed or specific exemptions (e.g., sport pilots using a driver’s license).

**Example**: A commercial pilot operating a charter flight under Part 135 must hold a valid Second-Class medical certificate, renewed annually, ensuring they meet standards for vision, hearing, and overall health.

## FAR Part 91: General Operating and Flight Rules

**FAR Part 91** establishes the general operating and flight rules for all aircraft operations in the United States, unless a more specific regulation (e.g., Parts 121 or 135) applies. It serves as the baseline for safe aircraft operation.

### Key Points:
- **Scope**: Governs all aircraft operations, including general aviation, private flights, and some commercial operations not covered by other parts.
- **Pilot Responsibilities**: The pilot-in-command (PIC) is responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft, including preflight inspections, ensuring airworthiness, and complying with air traffic control (ATC) instructions.
- **Flight Rules**: Includes Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), specifying weather minimums, fuel requirements, and right-of-way rules.
- **Aircraft Requirements**: Mandates that aircraft be airworthy, with required inspections (e.g., annual inspections) and equipment (e.g., ELT, transponder) for specific operations.
- **Special Operations**: Covers unique activities like aerobatic flight, banner towing, and experimental aircraft operations.

**Who It Affects**: All pilots and aircraft operators, from private pilots flying small planes to corporate jet operators, unless operating under Parts 121 or 135.

**Example**: A private pilot flying a Cessna 172 for personal use must comply with Part 91 rules, such as maintaining VFR weather minimums and ensuring the aircraft has a current annual inspection. They must also hold a valid Third-Class medical certificate or operate under BasicMed.

## FAR Part 121: Operating Requirements for Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations

**FAR Part 121** regulates air carriers conducting scheduled passenger or cargo operations, typically involving large commercial airlines. It imposes stringent safety and operational standards.

### Key Points:
- **Scope**: Applies to air carriers operating scheduled flights (domestic or international) and some supplemental (charter) operations with large aircraft (more than 30 seats or 7,500 pounds payload).
- **Crew Requirements**: Mandates specific training, qualifications, and rest periods for pilots, flight attendants, and other crew members. Pilots must hold an ATP certificate and a First-Class medical certificate.
- **Aircraft Standards**: Requires aircraft to meet rigorous maintenance and inspection schedules, including continuous airworthiness programs.
- **Operational Rules**: Covers flight planning, dispatch, weather minimums, and emergency procedures. It also mandates the use of a qualified dispatch team for flight operations.
