When you’re getting ready to fly, it’s not enough to just check the weather or file a flight plan—your aircraft itself must be **airworthy and legal**.  
To help pilots keep track of the required inspections, the FAA world often uses the acronym **AVIATES**.  

Here’s what each letter stands for:

---

## A – Annual Inspection
- A complete inspection of the aircraft.  
- Must be signed off by an **A&P mechanic with Inspection Authorization (IA)**.  
- Due every **12 calendar months**.  

---

## V – VOR Checks
- Required only for **IFR flight**.  
- Must be done every **30 days**.  
- Can be logged by the pilot, mechanic, or avionics shop.  
- Record must include date, place, error, and signature.  

---

## I – 100-Hour Inspection
- Similar to the annual inspection.  
- Required only if the aircraft is **used for hire** (rental, training, commercial operations).  
- Must be performed every **100 hours of flight time**.  
- Can be signed off by an **A&P mechanic** (IA not required).  

---

## A – Airworthiness Directives (ADs)
- Issued by the FAA when a safety issue is found.  
- **Mandatory compliance** is required—unlike service bulletins.  
- Some are **one-time**; others are **recurring**.  

---

## T – Transponder
- Required for flights in **controlled airspace** where a transponder is needed.  
- Must be inspected and tested every **24 calendar months**.  

---

## E – ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter)
- Checked every **12 calendar months**.  
- Battery must be replaced if:  
  - Used for more than **1 cumulative hour**, or  
  - Reaches **50% of its useful life**.  

---

## S – Static System
- Also known as the **altimeter and static system check**.  
- Required for IFR flight in controlled airspace.  
- Must be inspected every **24 calendar months**.

## Wrapping It Up
The **AVIATES** acronym gives you a quick way to check if your airplane is legal to fly:  

**A** – Annual (12 months)  
**V** – VOR (30 days, IFR)  
**I** – 100-hour (if for hire)  
**A** – Airworthiness Directives (as required)  
**T** – Transponder (24 months)  
**E** – ELT (12 months or battery replacement)  
**S** – Static System (24 months, IFR)  

Next time you preflight, run through **AVIATES** in your head—you’ll know both you and your airplane are ready for takeoff.
