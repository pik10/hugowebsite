## ATOMATOFLAMES

Part 91.205 regulation specifies the required equipment for an aircraft to be legal.

ATOMATOFLAMES is the acronym that can be used to remember VFR required equipment for day flight.

**A** - Airspeed indicator<br>
**T** - Tachometer for each engine<br>
**O** - Oil pressure for each engine<br>
**M** - Magnetic compass<br>
**A** - Altimeter<br>
**T** - Temperature gauge for each liquid-cooled engine<br>
**O** - Oil temperature gauge for each air-cooled engine<br>
**F** - Fuel gauges<br>
**L** - Landing gear position indicator, if the aircraft has retractable gear<br>
**A** - Anti-collision light, red or white<br>
**M** - Manifold pressure gauge for each altitude engine<br>
**E** - ELT (emergency locator transmitter, if required by FAR Part 91.207)<br>
**S** - Safety gear, including seat belts and shoulder harness plus floatation gear if the flight is operated beyond glide distance from shore

## Required Equipment for VFR Night Flight - FLAPS

You need the equipment from ATOMATOFLAMES plus FLAPS for VFR night flying.

**F** - Fuses (one spare set, or three of each kind used; must be accessible to the pilot)<br>
**L** - Landing lights (only required when operating for hire)<br>
**A** - Anti-collision light, red or white<br>
**P** - Position lights (red, green, and white navigation lights)<br>
**S** - Source of electricity, adequate for all the installed equipment (e.g. the alternator)

## Required Equipment for IFR Flight - GRAB CARD D

You need the equipment from ATOMATOFLAMES, FLAPS, and GRAB CARD D for IFR flight.

**G** – Generator or alternator<br>
**R** – Radios, both comm and nav, appropriate for the flight<br>
**A** – Altimeter (sensitive, adjustable for barometric pressure)<br>
**B** – Ball (slip-skid indicator)<br>
**C** – Clock with a sweeping seconds hand or digital display<br>
**A** – Attitude indicator<br>
**R** – Rate of turn indicator<br>
**D** – Directional gyro<br>
**D** – DME, if operating above FL240
